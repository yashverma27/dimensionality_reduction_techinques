It’s not feasible to analyze each and every variable at a microscopic level. 
It might take us days or months to perform any meaningful analysis and we’ll lose a ton of time and money for our business! Not to mention the amount of computational power this will take.
We need a better way to deal with high dimensional data so that we can quickly extract patterns and insights from it. So how do we approach such a dataset? Using dimensionality reduction techniques, of course. 
You can use this concept to reduce the number of features in your dataset without having to lose much information and keep (or improve) the model’s performance. 
It’s a really powerful way to deal with huge datasets.
